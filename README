The Game
========
This game is a combination of DigDug and Mr Do with some of my own ideas
thrown in. Its pretty simple to figure out, you have to collect all the gold 
nuggets to finish the level and avoid being killed. There are however some
things that need to be mentioned:

- You have a ball you can throw down the tunnel at the enemies.

- There are 3 main powerups - invisibility, freeze and superball. The first 
  one makes you invisible to spookies and grubbles and they won't follow you. 
  However if you run into them you still die but you are immune to wurmals. 
  It has no effect on spiky behaviour. Freeze freezes all enemies in position
  and you can move through and past them without a problem. Superball allows
  your ball to kill more than 1 enemy at a time.

- Other powerups are bonus points and turbo enemy. Be careful of the latter,
  it doubles your enemies speed!

- When a wurmal eats a nugget it goes black and is now worthless but you 
  still have to collect it to complete the level.

- Wurmals can only be killed by running into them when you are invisible or 
  when they are frozen. Sometimes however they can get themselves stuck at
  a tunnel junction and their eyes will go black.

- Spikys appear and disappear at random from level 4 onwards and can only be 
  killed by a falling boulder. Your ball hitting them simply makes them 
  reverse direction.

- Dig under boulders to undermine them and cause them to fall onto whatever
  is below.

- Boulders can be pushed (slowly) until they fall down a shaft.

- If you complete a level without losing a life in that level then your
  score gets a bonus worth 200 + 100 * level

- You get a bonus life every 8000 points.

Sound
=====
The sound system can use either the old OpenSound system (which IMO is better
for games - less latency, no buffer underrun and no mysteriously "dropped"
sounds) or ALSA. Note that this is a compilation not runtime option. To have 
any sound at all the SOUND macro must be included in the Makefile and to 
specifically use Alsa the ALSA macro must also be defined else it defaults to 
compiling in OpenSound.

The OpenSound system writes directly to the /dev/audio or /dev/dsp device. 
This means if something else is using that then the game won't be able to
and you'll see a "Device or resource busy" error. To get around this use the 
"aoss" command. eg: "aoss sen"


Operating systems
=================
This game will compile and run on Linux & FreeBSD and should work on OS/X
though sound will only work on Linux so if you're running something else 
comment out the SOUND=-DSOUND in the Makefile. The binary created is called
"digg".


Known bugs
==========
When the sound is being sent via ALSA some very short sounds sometimes don't
get played - eg when eating nuggets. I haven't figured out why this is yet.


Bug reports
===========
Send an email and a core dump (linux only) if appropriate to 
neil@ogham.demon.co.uk

Have fun!
