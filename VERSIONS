April 2011
==========
1.0.0
- Initial release

1.0.1
- Bug: Nuggets could appear partially offscreen making it harder for the 
  player to see them.
- Bug: Score not being reset to zero in attract mode.
- Bug: Top ground line didn't change colour during freeze powerup.
- Modified "READY!" message slightly.

1.0.2
- Updated boulder code so a player can undermine it a bit further below and
  reduce the possibility of getting stuck and squashed.
- Minor bug fixes and code updates

1.0.3
- Bug: End of level bonus score didn't work when bonus life given.
- Bug: Spiky change direction counter value was too large.
- Modified spiky appearance timings and lifespan.
- Will now only get 1 spiky appearing at any one time on levels 4 -> 6
- Wurmals no longer eat invisibility powerups. I decided it was unreasonable 
  that they ate the only thing that the player can use to kill them.
- Changed command line options. Since the game requires a square window -w and 
  -h have been replaced by -size as there wasn't much point having seperate 
  width and height options. The window can still be resize manually to a non 
  square shape if required. -d has become -disp.
- Improved autoplay
- Other minor code mods

1.0.4
- Bug: Tunnels being drawn 1 pixel too narrow which meant occasionally it 
  would look as if the ball and spiky were moving through 1 pixel wide walls.
- Minor code change in Spooky.


September 2012
==============
1.0.5
- Bug: Fixed in low pass filter sound code - caused a clicking noise
- Bug: Error in sawtooth sound generation
- Backported sound test code from Sentinel (-sndtest command line option)
- Changed quit key from 'Q' to ESC. This should prevent any accidental
  quitting of a game during play.
- Made level text a bit thicker


April 2013
==========
1.1.0
- Added ALSA sound support.
- Changed gameplay so that you can't bounce ball off wall you're digging through
  but must turn around. Compensated for slightly by making turning faster.

- Rewrote main input event loop


June 2013
=========
1.1.1
- Removed some redundant sound code


July 2013
=========
1.1.2
- More sound.cc updates
- Updated Makefile


August 2016
===========
1.1.3
- Changed default ALSA sound device to "sysdefault"
- Added -adev option to specific alternative ALSA device
- Replace the -delay option with -ref which doesn't slow the game down when
  reducing the framerate.
- Put more information in title bar


March 2023
==========
1.1.4
- Fixed incorrect key message in attract screen. Said 'Q' to quit whereas it's
  been Escape since 1.0.5.
- Upgraded some of the code to C++ 2011 standard (too much to do all of it).
- General code tidying and improvements.
